# lilnas

A Lil' Network-Assisted Storage (NAS) solution for people unwiling to invest in
Google Photos (or don't want to worry about image quality losses). The hardware
requirements are pretty simple, just have a device you can connect to the
internet and a storage device you can connect to it with. 

<font style="color: #ff9999;"> note: To support systems with limited network control, we also aim to support a
UDP Hole-Punching protocol in the future to avoid requiring port-forwarding. </font>
